# Discord Email Bot


In bot.py is the source code for a discord bot that will send an email if a user uses the command and types in the paramaters.

This is very simple and if you wish to change anything you can.

If you actually understand python you can change everything/anything, even make it not based on templates, but I haven't because my use-case is only templates.

There is NO protection from any user in your server from using this bot, so if you want to use it please add some sort of requirement to use the bots commands.
In my use case its a server with other developers in which I trust so I didn't add it.

You need: 
Python (3)
Pip
py-cord (pip install py-cord) 

might need something else but i forgot
